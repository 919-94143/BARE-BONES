BARE-BONES: OVERVIEW

This game will eventually be a collection of short puzzle experiences, each more
complex than the last, and will serve as both a way for me to familiarise myself
with coding 2D projects, and as an introduction to my style for anyone interested.

At present, LAYER-1 is largely complete. There is a link to the download page on
my itch.io profile within the BARE-BONES repository.

Go get some bones :)
